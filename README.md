• So what is LinkBridge?

In 2015, entrepreneurship was on the rise in Mexico, reaching 1 in 5 persons (21 percent), with a growing participation of both young people and women, who were motivated by a desire for opportunity and advancement (Naranjo, Campos, & Ló, 2016). The Fintech ecosystem in Mexico continues to show excellent dynamism. Since 2016, the number of Fintech ventures in the country has grown at an average rate of 23 percent per year, according to the latest edition of the Fintech Radar of Mexico that Finnovista has prepared with data extracted in the framework of data collection for the III Report Fintech in Latin America 2020 held in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). According to the same source, Mexico identifies 441 Fintech startups in the country, which represents an annual increase of 14 percent in the number of those start-ups (Finnovista, 2020). Almost one third of startups in Mexico operate in the financial services sector, followed by healthcare, information and communication technologies (ICT), and education. Startup ecosystems are distributed within Mexico. The start-up ecosystems are more distributed in Mexico, with 32 percent of startu-ps are in Mexico City; 10 percent in Guadalajara; and 8 percent in Monterrey (Oficina Económica y Comercial de la Embajada de España en México, 2018).


However, there are people who do not know how to wisely invest their money. Many entrepreneurs do not develop their projects due to the lack of having access to capital. According to the 2019 Economic Censuses, the life expectancy of businesses in Mexico was 7.8 years (a figure that varies based on the sector) due to weak finances, lack of goals and poor planning. Furthermore, the Center for the Development of Business Competitiveness revealed that 8 out of 10 Mexican companies fail during the first 2 years of existence. Since between 2019 and 2020, 20.8 percent of companies in Mexico ceased to exist; the business death rate increased in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the 2020/2021 Business Demography Study, carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) (Arzate Noticias, 2021). In addition, Professionals seeking job offers sometimes rely on traditional job means to find jobs, including recruitment agencies and social media. While, over 85 percent of businesses say social media helps them locate and engage inactive job searchers, according to a recent poll, (Apollo Technical, 2022) the average employee remains at a job for 4.1 years (the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020). Moreover, applying for loans could require lengthy processes and on-branch attendance in financial institutions for the purposes of identity verifications and documents submission. Purchasing goods using cryptocurrencies directly at vendors in many countries is still not acceptable.


One of the Mexican ecosystems that has been brewing for a while now is “Startuplinks”, which offers, according to its page, upon the registration of a startup the ability to find mentors, strategic alliances and funds (Startuplinks, 2022). According to Statista, in North America alone, crowdfunding raises $17.2 billion every year (Statista Research Department, 2021). And this number is continually increasing; forecasts for the crowdfunding industry indicate that it will reach stratospheric heights in the coming years. For the following four years, it is predicts a compound annual growth rate of 14.7 percent by 2030 (Statista Research Department, Crowdfunding, 2021), the total amount of money raised through crowdfunding is expected to surpass $300 billion (Jain, 2018). According to Business Wire, this expansion is expected to generate an additional $89.72 billion by 2022 (Maida, 2019).
